I am a joint PhD student in [Neural Computation](http://compneuro.cmu.edu/) and [Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by
[Mike Tarr](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/people/core-training-faculty/tarr-michael.html) and
[Leila Wehbe](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/).

I study visual and semantic processing in the human brain. In my work, I collect data using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and use models from computer vision and natural language processing to model brain responses of viewing natural images and movies. 

Before joining CMU, I received a B.A. in Cognitive Science and Statistics from UC Berkeley.

Other than research, I enjoy rock climbing, cooking, pottery and reading.
